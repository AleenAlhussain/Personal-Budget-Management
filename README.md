🚀 **Exciting Project Alert!** 🎉  

I’m working on a **Personal Budget Management App** using **React.js**, **MUI**, **Redux**, and **React Router v6**! This app empowers users to track their finances, manage transactions, and gain insights with visual reports.  

### Key Features:
💰 **Dashboard:**  
- View total income, expenses, and balance at a glance.  
- Summarized list of recent transactions & top spending categories.  

📝 **Transaction Management:**  
- Add, edit, or delete transactions with details like type, amount, category, and date.  
- Filter & sort transactions by date, category, or amount.  
- Set and adjust your total budget balance.  

📊 **Financial Reports:**  
- Pie charts for expense categories & income-to-expense comparison.  
- Line charts for spending and income trends.  
- Export income and expense reports to Excel, with customizable date ranges (using `exceljs`).  

Stay tuned for updates! 🔧💻
