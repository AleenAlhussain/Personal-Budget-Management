🚀 **Exciting Project Alert!** 🎉  

I’m working on a **Personal Budget Management App** using **React.js**, **MUI**, **Redux**, and **React Router v6**! This app empowers users to track their finances, manage transactions, and gain insights with visual reports.  

### Key Features:
💰 **Dashboard:**  
- View total income, expenses, and balance at a glance.  
- Summarized list of recent transactions & top spending categories.  

📝 **Transaction Management:**  
- Add, edit, or delete transactions with details like type, amount, category, and date.  
- Filter & sort transactions by date, category, or amount.  
- Set and adjust your total budget balance.  

📊 **Financial Reports:**  
- Pie charts for expense categories & income-to-expense comparison.  
- Line charts for spending and income trends.  
- Export income and expense reports to Excel, with customizable date ranges (using `exceljs`).
  
### Technologies Used
  #### Front-end: React.js for dynamic UI and MUI for modern, responsive design.
  #### State Management: Redux for robust data handling and state synchronization.
  #### Routing: React Router v6 for navigation and page organization.
  #### Data Export: ExcelJS library for creating downloadable Excel reports.
